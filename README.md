The Art of Unit Testing is a book written by [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/)

The book code examples are written in C# and the tools that appears in it are from the .NET community.

## Goal of this repository

I would like that people that works using Node.js could enjoy of the knowledge that this book offers to its readers. Therefore I going to use Node.js to write the code examples and I going to use tools typically related with it. :heart_eyes:

The style of the code and the chosen tools are 100% my decision. (The good and the bad parts! :kissing_closed_eyes:)

### Chapters

1. The basics of unit testing
2. A first unit test

Working in the rest of the chapters... :grin:

## How study the repository

1. For every chapter of the book has I created a directory
   where appears the final version of the code in the mentioned chapter.

2. Every commit has a reference to the chapter related. Any change I needed to do has a commit, with the objective of follow the flow of the book.

## How to use

### Setup

Install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to execute the all tests I created:

```bash
npm run test
```
